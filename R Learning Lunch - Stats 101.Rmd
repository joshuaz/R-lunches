## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

  <div id="Introductions">

  The goal of this session is to introduce you to basic functions in R for 
  descriptive statistics. 
  
  We will start from scratch with a dataset, and learn how to generate mean, median, 
  variance, create crosstabs or tables, and conduct statistical tests such as t-test and chi-square.

  As the labs progress, you are encouraged to explore beyond what the labs dictate;
  a willingness to experiment will make you a much better programmer. Before we 
  get to that stage, however, you need to build some basic fluency in R. Today we
  begin with the fundamental building blocks of R and RStudio: the interface, 
  reading in data, and basic commands.

## Install Packages
Here're a list of packages we'll use in this session. Use install.packages("PACKAGE NAME") to install them, then use library(PACKAGE NAME) to load.

```{r loadpackages}
library(rstudioapi)
library(car)
library(ggplot2)
library(lsr)
library(psych)
```

## Load your data

First, We need to tell R where to look for the dataset. To do that, we "set the working 
directory" and specify the file path of our dataset. To confirm that the working directory 
is correct, use getwd()

```{r setwd_1}
setwd("C:/Users/mxu/Documents/PD/R/Stats 101")
getwd()

```

Alternatively, if you have a habit of keeping your R file and your dataset in one folder, 
you can use the code below to have R automatically detect the location of your R file 
as the working directory.

```{r setwd_2}
setwd(dirname(rstudioapi::getActiveDocumentContext()$path))
getwd()

```

Now let's call on our dataset. cruise is a survey dataset that examines respondents'
interest in various locations, preferences in trip lenghts, etc.

Our dataset is a .csv format, therefore we use read.csv to import the file. We assign
the dataset to a variable named as "cruise.""

```{r cruise-read files}

cruise <- read.csv('cruise.csv', check.names=FALSE)

```

Time to explore! Let's first see how many rows (observations) and columns (variables)
are there, and basic attributes.


```{r cruise-summary}
dim(cruise)
str(cruise$`When was your last cruise with ABC Cruises ?`)
summary(cruise$`Duration of Trip (days) - Alaska`)
names(cruise)
```

## Central Tendency

```{r cruise-centraltendency}
duration<-cruise$`Duration of Trip (days) - Alaska`
mean(duration)

mean(duration,na.rm = TRUE)
median(duration,na.rm = TRUE)
range(duration,na.rm = TRUE)

mean(cruise$AGE_AT_SAIL)
median(cruise$AGE_AT_SAIL)
sd(cruise$AGE_AT_SAIL)
var(cruise$AGE_AT_SAIL)
max(cruise$AGE_AT_SAIL)
min(cruise$AGE_AT_SAIL)
quantile(cruise$AGE_AT_SAIL)

boxplot(cruise$AGE_AT_SAIL)
boxplot(AGE_AT_SAIL ~ CRUISE_EXPERIENCE, data = cruise)
boxplot(AGE_AT_SAIL ~ CRUISE_EXPERIENCE, data = cruise, varwidth=TRUE)
#What are the whiskers?? https://www.r-bloggers.com/whisker-of-boxplot/

summary(cruise$AGE_AT_SAIL[cruise$CRUISE_EXPERIENCE == "RPT"])
summary(cruise$AGE_AT_SAIL[cruise$CRUISE_EXPERIENCE == "FTB"])


```


## Including Plots
We are going to use both base R functions and ggplot2 to create visuals.

```{r cruise-plot}
##Define x-axis
hist(duration)
hist(duration, xlim = c(0,25))
hist(duration, breaks=seq(0,84,by=1),xlim = c(0,25))

table(duration)


table(duration)

library(ggplot2)
hist(cruise[,57],counts=1100)

ggplot(cruise, aes(duration)) +
  geom_histogram(breaks=seq(0, 40, by = 1), col="black", fill="blue", alpha = .5) + 
  labs(title="Duration of Trip - Alaska") + labs(x="Day", y="Count") + 
  xlim(c(0,40)) + ylim(c(0,1200)) 

p<-ggplot() +
  geom_histogram(data=cruise, aes(cruise$`Now, please tell us how many port days and how many sea days you would prefer to have on a cruise to these regions. - Alaska - Preferred # of Port Days`), breaks=seq(0, 20, by = 2), col="black", fill="blue", alpha = .3) +
  geom_histogram(data=cruise, aes(cruise$`Now, please tell us how many port days and how many sea days you would prefer to have on a cruise to these regions. - Alaska - Preferred # of Sea Days`), breaks=seq(0, 20, by = 2), col="black", fill="red", alpha = .5) +
  labs(title="Duration of Trip - Alaska - Sea vs Port Days") + labs(x="Day", y="Count") + 
  xlim(c(0,20))

```

## T-Test

Next, let's use R to perform t tests. We will look at AGE_AT_SAIL across gender.

```{r t-tests}

#subset data
Female <- subset(cruise, GENDER_CODE=="F")
Male <- subset(cruise, GENDER_CODE=="M")

#Check for normality
shapiro.test(Female$AGE_AT_SAIL)
sample_f <- Female[sample(1:nrow(cruise), 500,
  	replace=FALSE),]

sample_m <- Male[sample(1:nrow(cruise), 500,
  	replace=FALSE),]

shapiro.test(sample_m$AGE_AT_SAIL)

#Levene test (for Shao Wei)
leveneTest(cruise$AGE_AT_SAIL ~ cruise$GENDER_CODE, data = cruise)
var.test(Female$AGE_AT_SAIL, Male$AGE_AT_SAIL)

#T-Test using base R
t.test(Female$AGE_AT_SAIL, Male$AGE_AT_SAIL,var.equal=FALSE, paired=FALSE)

#Use lsr package
independentSamplesTTest(AGE_AT_SAIL ~ GENDER_CODE, data = cruise, var.equal = FALSE)

# independent 2-group Using Wilcox Test when looking at a numeric variable across a binary factor
sample_cruise <- cruise[sample(1:nrow(cruise), 500,
  	replace=FALSE),]

wilcox.test(sample_cruise$AGE_AT_SAIL ~ sample_cruise$GENDER_CODE) 

```

What to do when t-test assumptions are violated?

## Create Frequency Tables and Crosstabs
table()
prop.table()

```{r cruise-table}
x<-table(cruise$REGION_CODE, useNA = 'a')
x

y<-table(cruise$REGION_CODE, cruise$`When was your last cruise with ABC Cruises ?`)
y

prop.table(y)

prop.table(y,1)

```
